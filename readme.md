# Infini-Transformer

## Overview

Infini-Transformer ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07143)) is a powerful and versatile transformer model designed for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques and architectures to achieve exceptional performance and scalability to infinite context lengths.

## Features

- Scalable architecture for handling long sequences
- Large-scale pre-training on diverse datasets
- Support for multiple downstream tasks, including text classification, question answering, and language generation
- Efficient fine-tuning for task-specific adaptation
